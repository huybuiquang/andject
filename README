Simple lightweight dependency injectionn for android. 
Basic principes
  - activity is a container
  - there are 2 scopes:
      - activity instance alive
      - activity in foreground
  - configuration via annotations
  - injection triggered manually,  or via inherited base activity class

Contributions and ideas welcome.
